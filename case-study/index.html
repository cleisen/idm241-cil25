                Currently, the only microinteraction on the National Geographic 
                Browsing page is when you hover, the cursor changes to a pointer. 
                When browsing shows, it is almost completely unnoticeable that these 
                cards are clickable. There is nothing exciting about interacting with 
                this page, and I want to change that.

            <h2>1 - COMPETITOR RESEARCH</h2>
            <div class="flex__container">
                I started by looking at what else is out there. How do other websites 
                solve this issue?

                <div class="text-left">
                    When you hover on a hulu tv show, a border appears to emphasize 
                    which you are hovering on, the image darkens, and a quick summary 
                    of the show rises up beneath the title. 
                </div>
                <div class="text-right">
                    When you hover on a pbs tv show, an information button appears as 
                    well as the words “preview show”.
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="flex__container">
                I was inspired by the solutions these websites implemented to give 
                feedback to the users when browsing tv shows, and I wanted to bring 
                some of these elements into my own design.

            <h2>2 - ALPHA</h2>
            <div class="flex__container">
                The first step was to figure out what I want to happen when the users 
                hover on a card. I ended up designing this first step to be when a user 
                hovers on the tv show, the image zooms in and a white glow appears around 
                the outside.
            </div>
            <img src="images/alpha.gif" class="alpha one_image">
        
            <div class="flex__container">
                This helped make it more engaging and apparent that the user is hover 
                over a specific show
            </div>
            <br>
            This was built using only HTML & CSS and you can interact with the 
            alpha build here: 
            <a class="link" href="https://christinaleisen.com/idm241/alpha/build/" target="_blank">https://christinaleisen.com/idm241/alpha/build/</a> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h2>3 - BETA</h2>
            For the next step I decided to implement an information button similar to pbs, 
            but when you hover on that, more information appears similar to what I noticed 
            from hulu, but in an overlay box instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this information overlay, I also included a “watch now” button so users 
            can easily start watching the show without having to click into the details 
            page and find it.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can interact with the beta build here: 
            <a class="link" href="https://christinaleisen.com/idm241/beta/build/" target="_blank">https://christinaleisen.com/idm241/beta/build/</a> 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h2>4 - DESIGN INSPIRATION</h2>
            Because my beta build information overlay contained only filler text and an 
            unstyled HTML button, I needed to look back at the National Geographic site 
            to see what kinds of styles they use that I can implement.
            <br>
            <br>
            When clicking into a TV show on their site, here are some things I paid 
            attention to:
            <img src="images/paragraph.png" class="paragraph one_image">
            The title is displayed in a very large font and centered, along with the 
            description in small font.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, the background of this page consists of a mixture of dark green and 
            black, so I took inspiration from that for the color of the information overlay.
            <img src="images/my-list.png" class="my-list one_image">
            There is an add to my list button that I thought could be a good thing to 
            have quick access to in the information overlay.
            <img src="images/logo.png" class="logo one_image">
            Their logo consists of yellow, black, and white, so I wanted to incorporate 
            that as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <h2>5 - FINAL</h2>
            Here is a comparison between the Beta and the Final where you can really 
            see the design inspiration take action:
            <div class="compare">
                <div class="img_left">
                    <img src="images/beta.png" class="">
                    Beta
                </div>
                <div class="img_left">
                    <img src="images/final.png" class="">
                    Final
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            When building the microinteractions before this point, I had only used
             HTML & CSS, but I quickly learned I needed to add Javascript to my 
             project in order to correctly implement a plus to checkmark microinteraction.
            <br>
            <br>
            To experiment in a clean workspace I took my idea to codepen, and this 
            is where I was able to work with a trial and error approach without the 
            possibility of ruining my other code.


            <div class="title">
                SOLUTION
            </div>
            <hr>
            Screen recording of the final set of microinteractions:
            <br>
            <video class="one_image" width="400" height="500" controls="" 
            src="images/final-video.mov"></video>
            Although this example only shows the interaction of one card, when 
            implemented in the actual environment, there would be multiple of 
            these cards in a row as shown in the hero image at the top of the page.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can interact with the final build here: 
            <a class="link" href="https://christinaleisen.com/idm241/final/build/" target="_blank">https://christinaleisen.com/idm241/final/build/</a> 


            <div class="title">
                RESULT
            </div>
            <hr>
            With these new microinteractions, users are now more engaged when browsing 
            for a show on the National Geographic website. They also are able to access 
            useful information quickly which makes their overall experience more efficient.
