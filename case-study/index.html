                Currently, the only microinteraction on the National Geographic 
                Browsing page is when you hover, the cursor changes to a pointer. 
                When browsing shows, it is almost completely unnoticeable that these 
                cards are clickable. There is nothing exciting about interacting with 
                this page, and I wanted to change that.

                I started by looking at what else is out there. How do other websites 
                solve this issue?

                    When you hover on a hulu tv show, a border appears to emphasize 
                    which you are hovering on, the image darkens, and a quick summary 
                    of the show rises up beneath the title.

                    When you hover on a pbs tv show, an information button appears as

                I was inspired by the solutions these websites implemented to give 
                feedback to the users when browsing tv shows, and I wanted to bring 
                some of these elements into my own design.

            <div class="flex__container">
                The first step was to figure out what I want to happen when the users 
                hover on a card. I ended up designing this first step to be when a user 
                hovers on the tv show, the image zooms in and a white glow appears around 
                the outside.

                This helped make it more engaging and apparent that the user is hover
